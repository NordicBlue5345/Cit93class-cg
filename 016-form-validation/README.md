# Week 8
## Does else block make sense?

- The concept of else block does make sense to me. I have see this before when trying to get help in other areas and the concept of it is something Im understanding. I know as I keep writing it it will stick.
- the only thing that is frustrating is Live server. It is not running things in a way that is helpful right now and im spend more time on getting it working then I would like.

- for the 1st challenge. I have this issue where my message clears on its own within like half a second. Its so quick that I don't have time to read the message the 1st time lol. I have to run it a few times to make sure its correct lol Is there a way to fix that? But if I was to suggest what to do, wouldn't it be adding code that has the message clear after a specified amount of time. i believe this is called set timeout. I added it to the code as my attempt.

- for the 2nd challenge, I was able to get the average information into the server but was struggling to figure out how to get it under the form. As you see I was able to get a HI outside of it but couldn't figure out how to do it with the average. 

- so after watching the last video for this assignment, I realized I was a little confused and thought I had gotten the average information but realized that it was just the generic information we collected previously. After watching the video, i also realized that I had the right id to solve the issue, but was struggling a little on how to execute it. I had the new div but wasn't sure where to place it to make the code work. I will be definitely exploring this more in the future to better understand it.
