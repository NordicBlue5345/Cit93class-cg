## Does else block make sense?

- The concept of else block does make sense to me. I have see this before when trying to get help in other areas and the concept of it is something Im understanding. I know as I keep writing it it will stick.
- the only thing that is frustrating is Live server. It is not running things in a way that is helpful right now and im spend more time on getting it working then I would like.
