# week 6 video 1 my thoughts

*I am really excited to have you as a teacher again. I only had two thoughts after watching your video*

- While Leod had us do the folders in a 000 style, if it is easier for us can we create folders that make more sense to us. Like for week 6 create a week 6 folder and have all files that fall into it?

-You also mentoned that you found Leod bringing in Moduels this early interesting, and I was wondering if you could maybe do a small break down of what these do and why they could be important?
