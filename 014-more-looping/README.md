# Week 8

- I know im a little bit late on the suggestions, but if it was week 8 and I was doing this for the first time lol I would be 100% open to whatever you felt we should learn about. I want to know as much as possible when it comes to coding so that way I am more prepared for the future and whatever it entails.

- I was confusing when we would code on our own because then i would have to go back and redo the code for the next video. But when you suggest that we do a separate folder it worked out much better, we could code however we needed to without the fear of messing it up to no return lol
