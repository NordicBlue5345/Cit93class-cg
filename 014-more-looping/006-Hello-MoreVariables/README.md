## My thoughts

- I know we are in the process of working on week 17, so this is a little overdue but I couldn't find a reason not to do it still. I was happy to have you as our teacher when you took over, and despite my struggles I still enjoy having you this semester. 

- Your teaching style is helpful because it allows you to be more hands on rather than copy and paste. Do I struggle, yes, and this only happens when the code doesn't make sense or something is working properly.

- I cant say I like JS lol. I recognize that it is very important, but this doesn't mean it is my friend at this point in time lol

- I had VSCODE already set up and ready to go, despite McLeod wanting to use straight GIT

- I like the commit concept, it works well and helps keep things simple and organized
