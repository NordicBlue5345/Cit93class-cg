- So when thinking about questions to ask, I wanted them to be practical. These are the 5 questions I asked the Chatgpt

1. How do you explain JavaScript?

2. What are some examples of Functions?
- Here I wanted to see what kind of information it would give me if I asked for examples of functions and it gave me a handful of useful examples.]

3. What is a good tip when learning JavaScript.
- It gave me 8 useful tips, the top being start with the basics.

4. How would you explain Looping?
- I asked this to see if it could give me a simpler description of Looping, seeing as some of the definitions out there are heavy and dont always make sense. The AI broke it down really well and I walked away having a better understanding.

5. Is there a easier form of JavaScript?
- Yes, I did ask this and I was not disappointed. I discovered that Python is more beginner friendly than JavaScript and that there are also some visual tools you can use to learn code that is beginner friendly also.
