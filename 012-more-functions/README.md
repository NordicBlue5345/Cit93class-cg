# Week 7

## Am I using dev tools?
- Yes I have been using dev tools in the same fashion as you when working on the code. I did not know what Devtools were in the beginning but once I figured out that dev tools were what you were using in the weekly videos, then thinks started to run together.
- I find something I like about the Devtools is being able to see the code run while Im working on it, and being able to see when an error is encountered and where I should look for it. This is really helpful when trying to fix the code, because I can just jump to where it is telling me and fix it, rather than attempting to search for it.

## Does this Array concept Make sense?
- I think this concept is making sense for the most part. While it is still very new and not something I have looked at before, I can see where the useful functionality of it comes in handy.

## Was I able to find the error in the video?
- to be quite honest, I was not able to find the error in the video. But I think this is because I thought that the end results of my code was correct despite not showing up on the web page. This is because I was able to make the code work with no errors. I did enjoy seeing how you were able to fix the error and make the code work the way it is supposed to.
