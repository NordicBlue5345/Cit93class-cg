# Week 7

# Am I using dev tools?
- Yes I have been using dev tools in the same fashion as you when working on the code. I did not know what Devtools were in the beginning but once I figured out that dev tools were what you were using in the weekly videos, then thinks started to run together.
- I find something I like about the Devtools is being able to see the code run while Im working on it, and being able to see when an error is encountered and where I should look for it. This is really helpful when trying to fix the code, because I can just jump to where it is telling me and fix it, rather than attempting to search for it.
