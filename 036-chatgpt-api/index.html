    So for this assignment because I didnt have the original source you recommended in the video. I did a generic pull for the information you were wanting.
    I started by asking if it could help me make a header object and then if it could help me make it call to the api. It informed me I would need to do a Fetch 
    command and from there I was able to ask what needed to be changed to get a call back.
