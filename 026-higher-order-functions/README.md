## Higher Order Funtions
- takes a funtion as a parameter or returns a function
- is pretty heavily used

## Why?
- to perform some type of operation

- function is a series of commands
- can pass through expressions

- repetition is almost always a red flag

- you should always test your code

- Without high order functions we wouldnt have array filters or array reduce functions

- function factors are not to be confused with factor functions
