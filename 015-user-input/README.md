# week 8 User Input

## What would we want to add to the listener?

- I haven't watched the video yet, but I would think that you would want to add at the very least a error for if the specified areas were not filled out, and then maybe a message that says thank you or submitted. 
- we may even want to link to the form the answer to what we are submitting. So if the form is supposed to calculate the average of those 3 sections, maybe having code that shows that average?
